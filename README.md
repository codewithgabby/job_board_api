# 💼 Job Board API — Built with FastAPI

Welcome to the Job Board API — a backend project built with **FastAPI** that allows users to sign up, log in, and post job opportunities.

This was part of my backend engineering learning journey using Python and FastAPI. It helped me understand user authentication, relational databases, and API design using modern tools.

## 🚀 What the API Can Do

This is a simple yet powerful API that lets users:

- ✅ Register and log in with secure password hashing
- ✅ Get an access token via JWT (JSON Web Token)
- ✅ Post jobs (only after login)
- ✅ View all jobs
- ✅ View a specific job
- ✅ Update and delete their own jobs

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **FastAPI** – Python Web Framework
- **SQLAlchemy** – ORM for interacting with the database
- **SQLite** – Lightweight local database for testing
- **JWT** – Secure user authentication
- **Passlib (bcrypt)** – For password hashing
- **Pytest** – For automated testing

## 🧪 How to Test It

Once you start the server with:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
